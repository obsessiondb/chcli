# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full
documentation for it [in the main changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Using changesets

To create a new changeset, run `bun run changeset` in the root of the repo.
